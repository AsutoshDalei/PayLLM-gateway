# PayLLM

PayLLM is a conversational application designed to simplify the process of paying utility bills (e.g., electricity, gas, wifi) through natural language interactions. By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, PayLLM provides users with a seamless, intelligent way to manage their utility payments without the need for complex interfaces or manual processes.

## Key Features

- **Conversational Bill Payments**: PayLLM enables users to pay their utility bills by simply conversing with the application. Whether it's electricity, gas, or wifi, PayLLM understands user intent and handles payments in an automated yet conversational manner.

- **Powered by LLaMa 3.2**: At the heart of PayLLM is the LLaMa 3.2 language model, which powers the natural language processing capabilities. LLaMa 3.2 enables accurate understanding of user requests, allowing for intuitive and efficient bill management.

- **Agentic Framework**: PayLLM utilizes the LangChain/LangGraph agentic framework, which allows the application to intelligently call external tools when needed. The framework enables the orchestration of tasks such as fetching service providers, retrieving bills, and processing payments.

- **Automated Task Handling**: PayLLM automatically interacts with external APIs to retrieve real-time information, such as the latest bill amounts or available service providers. Once the information is gathered, users can confirm their actions, and PayLLM takes care of processing payments.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: A user starts a conversation with PayLLM by asking for specific tasks, such as “Show my latest electricity bill” or “Pay my wifi bill.”

2. **Task Identification & Tool Invocation**: Using the agentic framework, PayLLM identifies the appropriate action to take. It triggers the necessary tools or APIs to fetch relevant data, such as available service providers, billing information, or payment options.

3. **Data Retrieval**: Once PayLLM determines the required data, it fetches information from external sources. This may include pulling details about the user’s bill, the status of a service provider, or the payment status.

4. **Payment Execution**: After the user approves, PayLLM processes the payment for the bill. The entire transaction is managed in a seamless manner, with the user only needing to confirm the action.

## Benefits

- **User-Friendly**: No need to navigate through complex interfaces. Just talk to PayLLM, and it takes care of the rest.
- **Time-Saving**: Automatically fetches bills and handles payments, saving time compared to traditional methods.
- **Efficiency**: The agentic framework ensures that all tasks are executed in a logical order, reducing errors and improving performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for building PayLLM, providing the necessary infrastructure and logic for interactions.
- **LLaMa 3.2**: The language model that powers the conversational abilities of the app, enabling understanding and generation of natural language responses.
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: The agentic framework that coordinates and executes external tool calls for tasks like fetching bills and processing payments.

PayLLM brings an innovative approach to utility bill management by combining conversational AI with intelligent task orchestration, creating an effortless way to manage and pay utility bills.
